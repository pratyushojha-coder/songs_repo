Verse 1:
Woke up early with a dream in mind,
Lines of hope that I need to find,
Errors come but I don’t rewind,
Every bug makes me more refined.

Pre-Chorus:
Late night screens and coffee light,
Chasing goals till morning bright,
One more push, one more try,
Clouds may fall but I will fly.

Chorus:
I’m building dreams one line at a time,
Turning struggles into climb,
Every failure helps me grow,
Step by step, I start to glow.

Verse 2:
Keyboard tapping like a beat,
Small wins make the journey sweet,
Through the doubts and through the fear,
I see my future crystal clear.

Bridge:
When the system says “retry,”
I just breathe and aim up high,
Every setback fuels the flame,
I’m not quitting this game.

Final Chorus:
I’m building dreams one line at a time,
Turning struggles into climb,
From z
