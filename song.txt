Verse 1:
Woke up early with a dream in mind,
Lines of hope that I need to find,
Errors come but I don’t rewind,
Every bug makes me more refined.

Pre-Chorus:
Late night screens and coffee light,
Chasing goals till morning bright,
One more push, one more try,
Clouds may fall but I will fly.

Chorus:
I’m building dreams one line at a time,
Turning struggles into climb,
Every failure helps me grow,
Step by step, I start to glow.

Chalta hoon apne ek raah,

Zindagi ka safar hai yeh.

Verse 2:
Chhoti chhoti jeet meri,
Banti hai taqat meri,
Har mushkil ke paar mujhe,
Milti nayi roshni.

Bridge:
Jab duniya kahe ruk ja,
Dil kahe bas chal ja,
Apni mehnat pe yakeen,
Bas khud se tu mil ja.

Final Chorus:
Sapno ka safar hai yeh,
Dil se jo nikle asar hai yeh,
Aaj chhota ho sakta hoon,
Kal mera hi shehar hai yeh.
